## COOLiNG ONE SPiN BY SYSTEM OF FOUR SPINS 


A numerical simulation to cool a single spin by raising the temperature of three other spins. Initially, all the spins were set in thermal equilibrium. A compression unitary is  applied to the target spin, cooling it while heating the other three. The goal was to execute a permutation that enhances the likelihood of the target spin occupying the ground state, leading to the rethermalization of the other three spins. Finally, the unitary compression is applied once more.
